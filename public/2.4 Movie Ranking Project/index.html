<h1>The Best Movies According to Mike</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Hacksaw Ridge</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourites because it's a true story with a gripping story of how someone stuck to their core values even under extreme pressure.</p>

<h3>The Accountant</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourites because it provoked an emotional reaction in me at the end where all the main character wanted to use his money on was to help others with Autism.</p>

<h3>The Big Short</h3>
<p>Even though this can be a difficult film to get your head around. It's incredibly educational and the fact it's based on real life events really makes you consider your actions in the real world too.</p>
